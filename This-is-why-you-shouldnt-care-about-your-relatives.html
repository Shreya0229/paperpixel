            Especially in India, relatives can be very hard to handle. I mean, they are just drawing the
            youth down for not following certain rules or not doing certain things! I‚Äôve felt it so many times that my
            relatives are insulting me in front of everyone saying ‚Äòyou are too thin/fat, eat more/less‚Äô, I mean, Who
            are you making decisions of my life, It‚Äôs my life, I have a family to take care of me, who the f*ck are
            you?!
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">People not believing in your dreams is like a disease nowadays!</h2>
            Recently a month ago, I was in my hometown and I was at a relative‚Äôs house, that‚Äôs where I got a huge amount
            of fuel (motivation), let me tell you how, but let‚Äôs define a variable first, var relative='a relative
            person'; Ok, now it‚Äôs good. So, I was at my relative‚Äôs house for vacations(as my cousin also lives there),
            we were sitting and talking, and suddenly a talk came up with airplanes and stuff like abroad, and as of a
            sudden, my relative said that ‚Äúbeing on an airplane will just be in your dreams‚Äù, that‚Äôs when my amygdala
            was filled with a lot of lava, but as we know, a typical Indian home is that you can‚Äôt argue with a relative
            or any other elder as it doesn‚Äôt follow ‚Äòsanskar‚Äô in your family, and that‚Äôs also how I was nurtured, and
            till date whenever I see an airplane in the sky(every time I hear an airplane‚Äôs voice, I just leave all my
            work and run like a mad to see that tiny airplane in the skies and every time I watch it I make a commitment
            to myself that I‚Äôll ride that thing one day, and if I got enough opportunities, then I‚Äôll not hesitate in
            buying that whole damn plane! But, if I talk about my family and my relatives, I was really special(not
            disabled like special) and different from other children, I‚Äôve always admired Steve Jobs over Shakira and
            Mark Zuckerberg over Megan Fox, While every one of my age was busy playing PUBG, I was learning soft skills
            and constantly improving myself, bragging aside, let‚Äôs get to the moral of the blog, and that‚Äôs so simple,
            <br><br>
            ‚ÄòJust salute your relatives(who doesn‚Äôt believe in you) with your middle finger‚Äô That‚Äôs all! Once you master
            that art, You‚Äôll win, mark my words!
